      "longDescription": "In the demo, a hip designer, a sharply-dressed marketer, and a smiling, relaxed developer sip lattes and calmly discuss how Flex is going to make customers happy and shorten the workday   all while boosting the bottom line. The software systems they're using have been carefully selected and built from the ground up to work together seamlessly. There are no legacy systems, data, or competing business concerns to manage.    Cut to reality.    You're a Java developer. The marketing guy tells you that \"corporate\" wants a Flex-based site and you have to deliver it on top of what you already have. Your budget  Don't even ask. \"Make it look like the Discovery channel or something.\"    Flex on Java assumes you live in the real world   not the demo. This unique book shows you how to refactor an existing web application using the server-side you already know. You'll learn to use Flex 3 in concert with Spring, EJB 3, POJOs, JMS, and other standard technologies. Wherever possible, the examples use free or open source software.    The authors start with a typical Java web app and show you how to add a rich Flex interface. You also learn how to integrate Flex into your server-side Java via the BlazeDS framework, Adobe's open-source remoting and web messaging technology for Flex.    The book shows you how to deploy to not only the web but also to the desktop using the Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR). You will learn how to integrate Flex into your existing applications in order to build a next generation application that will delight users.    Flex on Java is approachable for anyone beginning Java and Flex development.    ",

      "longDescription": "Although several options exist for interface development in Java, even popular UI toolkits like Swing have been notoriously complex and difficult to use. Griffon, an agile framework that uses Groovy to simplify Swing, makes UI development dramatically faster and easier. In many respects, Griffon is for desktop development what Grails is for web development. While it's based on Swing, its declarative style and approachable level of abstraction is instantly familiar to developers familiar with other technologies such as Flex or JavaFX.    Griffon in Action is a comprehensive tutorial written for Java developers who want a more productive approach to UI development. In this book, you'll immediately dive into Griffon.

One of the troublesome parts of Swing development is the amount of Java code that is required to get a simple application off the ground.    You'll learn how SwingBuilder (and its cousin builders) present a very palatable alternative in the form of a DSL geared towards building graphical user interfaces. Pair it up with the convention over configuration paradigm, a well tested and tried application source structure (based on Grails) and you have a recipe for quick and effective Swing application development. Griffon in Action covers declarative view development, like the one provided by JavaFX Script, as well as the structure, architecture and life cycle of Java application development",

Enterprise OSGi addresses several shortcomings of existing enterprise platforms, such as allowing the creation of better maintainable and extensible applications, and provide a simpler, easier-to-use, light-weight solution to enterprise software development.",
      "longDescription": "A good application framework greatly simplifies a developer's task by providing reusable code modules that solve common, tedious, or complex tasks. Writing a great framework requires an extraordinary set of skills-ranging from deep knowledge of a programming language and target platform to a crystal-clear view of the problem space where the applications to be developed using the framework will be used.    OSGi Application Frameworks shows a Java developer how to build frameworks based on the OSGi service platform. OSGi, an emerging Java-based technology for developing modular applications, is a great tool for framework building. A framework itself, OSGi allows the developer to create a more intuitive, modular framework by isolating many of the key challenges the framework developer faces.    This book begins by describing the process, principles, and tools you must master to build a custom application framework. It introduces the fundamental concepts of OSGi, and then shows you how to put OSGi to work building various types of frameworks that solve specific development problems.    OSGi is particularly useful for building frameworks that can be easily extended by developers to create domain-specific applications. This book teaches the developer to break down a problem domain into its abstractions and then use OSGi to create a modular framework solution. Along the way, the developer learns software engineering practices intrinsic to framework building that result in systems with better software qualities, such as flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.    Author Alexandre Alves guides you through major concepts, such as the definition of programming models and modularization techniques, and complements them with samples that have real applicability using industry-proved technologies, such as Spring-DM and Equinox.",

This book takes you on an over-the-shoulder tour of the components of the Zend Framework as you build a high quality, real-world web application.",
      "longDescription": "From rather humble beginnings as the Personal Home Page scripting language, PHP has found its way into almost every server, corporation, and dev shop in the world. On an average day, somewhere between 500,000 and 2 million coders do something in PHP. Even when you use a well-understood language like PHP, building a modern web application requires tools that decrease development time and cost while improving code quality. Frameworks such as Ruby-on-Rails and Django have been getting a lot of attention as a result.     For PHP coders, the Zend Framework offers that same promise without the need to move away from PHP. This powerful collection of components can be used in part or as a whole to speed up the development process. Zend Framework has the backing of Zend Technologies; the driving force behind the PHP programming language in which it is written. The first production release of the Zend Framework became available in July of 2007.    Zend Framework in Action is a comprehensive tutorial that shows how to use the Zend Framework to create web-based applications and web services. This book takes you on an over-the-shoulder tour of the components of the Zend Framework as you build a high quality, real-world web application. This book is organized around the techniques you'll use every day as a web developer \"data handling, forms, authentication, and so forth. As you follow the running example, you'll learn to build interactive Ajax-driven features into your application without sacrificing nuts-and-bolts considerations like security and performance.  This book is aimed at the competent PHP developer who wants to master framework-driven web development. Zend Framework in Action goes beyond the docs but still provides quick access to the most common topics encountered in the development of web applications.  ",

A new category of powerful programming techniques lets you discover the patterns, inter-relationships, and individual profiles   the collective intelligence   locked in the data people leave behind as they surf websites, post blogs, and interact with other users.    Collective Intelligence in Action is a hands-on guidebook for implementing collective-intelligence concepts using Java. It is the first Java-based book to emphasize the underlying algorithms and technical implementation of vital data gathering and mining techniques like analyzing trends, discovering relationships, and making predictions. It provides a pragmatic approach to personalization by combining content-based analysis with collaborative approaches.    This book is for Java developers implementing collective intelligence in real, high-use applications. Following a running example in which you harvest and use information from blogs, you learn to develop software that you can embed in your own applications. The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit.    Along the way, you work with, a number of APIs and open-source toolkits including text analysis and search using Lucene, web-crawling using Nutch, and applying machine learning algorithms using WEKA and the Java Data Mining (JDM) standard.",

      "shortDescription": "\"Flexible Rails created a standard to which I hold other technical books. You definitely get your money's worth.\"",
      "longDescription": "Rails is a fantastic tool for web application development, but its Ajax-driven interfaces stop short of the richness you gain with a tool like Adobe Flex. Simply put, Flex is the most productive way to build the UI of rich Internet applications, and Rails is the most productive way to rapidly build a database-backed CRUD application. Together, they're an amazing combination.    Flexible Rails is a book about how to use Ruby on Rails and Adobe Flex to build next-generation rich Internet applications (RIAs). The book takes you to the leading edge of RIA development, presenting examples in Flex 3 and Rails 2.    This book is not an exhaustive Ruby on Rails tutorial, nor a Flex reference manual. (Adobe ships over 3000 pages of PDF reference documentation with Flex.) Instead, it's an extensive tutorial, developed iteratively, how to build an RIA using Flex and Rails together. You learn both the specific techniques you need to use Flex and Rails together as well as the development practices that make the combination especially powerful.    The example application built in the book is MIT-licensed, so readers can use it as the basis for their own applications. In fact, one reader has already built an agile project management tool based on the book example!    With this book, you learn Flex by osmosis. You can read the book and follow along even if you have never used Flex before. Consider it \"Flex Immersion.\" You absorb the key concepts of Flex as you go through the process of building the application.    You will also learn how Flex and Rails integrate with HTTPService and XML, and see how RESTful Rails controller design gracefully supports using the same controller actions for Flex and HTML clients. The author will show you how Cairngorm can be used to architect larger Flex applications, including tips to use Cairngorm in a less verbose way with HTTPService to talk to Rails.    Flexible Rails is for both Rails developers who are interested in Flex, and Flex developers who are interested in Rails. For a Rails developer, Flex allows for more dynamic and engaging user interfaces than are possible with Ajax. For a Flex developer, Rails provides a way to rapidly build the ORM and services layer of the application.",

      "longDescription": "In complex software projects, managing the development process can be as critical to success as writing the code itself. A project may involve dozens of developers, managers, architects, testers, and customers, hundreds of builds, and thousands of opportunities to get off-track. To keep tabs on the people, tasks, and components of a medium- to large-scale project, most teams use a development system that allows for easy monitoring, follow-up, and accountability.    Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2008 (TFS), the server component of Microsoft's Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), provides a powerful collaborative platform for software-development teams. The product offers an integrated toolset for tracking work items, creating test cases, managing source code, generating builds, constructing database schemas, and so on. Because in software development one size does not fit all, TFS provides process customization, project management, and reporting capabilities to build solutions around your requirements.    Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a hands-on guide to Team Foundation Server 2008. Written for developers with a good handle on TFS basics, this book shows you how to solve real-life problems. It's not a repetition of Microsoft's product documentation. Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a practitioner's handbook for how to work with TFS under common constraints. This book walks you through real-life software engineering problems based on hundreds of hours of TFS experience.    You'll benefit from expert author Jamil Azher's extensive interactions with members of Microsoft's TFS team and MVPs, survey feedback from the author's blog, and interviews with organizations and user groups using TFS. Instead of just offering a high-level overview, the book provides detailed solutions for solving common   and not-so-common   problems using TFS. It discusses the strengths as well as weaknesses of TFS, and suggests appropriate problem resolution steps, workarounds, or custom solutions.",

      "longDescription": "It's easy to get excited about building a new software project from scratch. So-called \"greenfield\" projects often involve learning new technology and the opportunity for experimentation. Working on established software projects may seem less glamorous.    Most software developers have inherited a monolithic application where the day-to-day tasks involve maintenance, incremental improvements, or even cleaning up the mess another programmer left behind. These legacy or brownfield projects often have tightly coupled components, low cohesion, and poor separation of concerns, making them fragile and resistant to change.    Brownfield Application Development in .Net shows you how to approach legacy applications with the state-of-the-art concepts, patterns, and tools you've learned to apply to new projects. Using an existing application as an example, this book guides you in applying the techniques and best practices you need to make it more maintainable and receptive to change.    Starting with the build process and the introduction of unit tests, the authors show you how to set up the application so that in later chapters, you can make incremental changes aimed at decoupling components from each other. Each practice introduced will increase your confidence and ability to make subsequent changes to your code.    As the book proceeds, the authors introduce frameworks and tools commonly used today while still approaching the subject from a conceptual level so that you can substitute alternate tools as appropriate. This book examines the reasons why a tool is necessary, not the tool itself. Because the book is based on the authors' experiences, Brownfield Application Development in .Net moves beyond the theories and shows you the techniques you need to be successful.",

Emphasis is on standalone and web-based business applications, such as for online sales and mass customization, but much of what this book offers has broad applicability to 3D user interfaces in other pursuits such as scientific visualization and gaming.  This book provides an extensive conceptual framework for 3D user interface techniques, and an in-depth introduction to user interface support in the Java 3D API, including such topics as picking, collision, and drag-and-drop. Many of the techniques are demonstrated in a Java 3D software framework included with the book, which also provides developers with many general-purpose building blocks for constructing their own user interfaces.    Applications and their use of 3D are approached realistically. The book is geared towards sophisticated user interfaces for the \"everyday user\" who doesn't have a lot of time to learn another application--much less a complicated one--and an everyday computer system without exotic devices like head mounted displays and data gloves. Perhaps the best description of this book is: \"A roadmap from Java 3D to 'Swing 3D'.\"",

      "longDescription": "Hibernate practically exploded on the Java scene. Why is this open-source tool so popular  Because it automates a tedious task: persisting your Java objects to a relational database. The inevitable mismatch between your object-oriented code and the relational database requires you to write code that maps one to the other. This code is often complex, tedious and costly to develop. Hibernate does the mapping for you.    Not only that, Hibernate makes it easy. Positioned as a layer between your application and your database, Hibernate takes care of loading and saving of objects. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more resilient to change. And they perform better than anything you are likely to develop yourself.    Hibernate in Action carefully explains the concepts you need, then gets you going. It builds on a single example to show you how to use Hibernate in practice, how to deal with concurrency and transactions, how to efficiently retrieve objects and use caching.    The authors created Hibernate and they field questions from the Hibernate community every day - they know how to make Hibernate sing. Knowledge and insight seep out of every pore of this book.",

Open-Source ESBs in Action describes how to use ESBs in real-world situations. You will learn how the various features of an ESB such as transformation, routing, security, connectivity, and more can be implemented on the example of two open-source ESB implementations: Mule and ServiceMix. The authors first introduce ServiceMix and Mule, and then present general principles and patterns of ESB use, as well as a structured approach to solving common integration problems, through examples using them.    Working in integration projects is exciting, with new technologies and paradigms arriving every day. In this area, open source is playing a more and more dominant role with projects such as Mule and ServiceMix. Open-Source ESBs in Action will help you to learn open-source integration technologies quickly and will provide you with knowledge that you can use to effectively work with Mule and ServiceMix.",

It offers productivity gains and useful features for any programmer, and is quickly gaining in popularity as a result. The only published source for the wxPython toolkit, co-authored by the toolkit s developer Robin Dunn, wxPython in Action shows readers why wxPython is a better interface tool than Tkinter, the tool that is distributed with Python.    Because they are often large and complex, GUI programming toolkits can be hard to use. wxPython is a combination of the Python programming language and the wxWidgets toolkit, which allows programmers to create programs with a robust, highly functional graphical user interface, simply and easily. wxPython combines the power of an exceptionally complete user interface toolkit with an exceptionally flexible programming language. The result is a toolkit that is unique in the ease with which complex applications can be built and maintained.    wxPython in Action is a complete guide to the wxPython toolkit, containing a tutorial for getting started, a guide to best practices, and a reference to wxPython s extensive widget set. After an easy introduction to wxPython concepts and programming practices, the book takes an in-depth tour of when and how to use the bountiful collection of widgets offered by wxPython. All features are illustrated with useful code examples and reference tables are included for handy lookup of an object s properties, methods, and events.

      "longDescription": "Clojure is a modern implementation of Lisp for the JVM, ideally suited for general programming and specialized tasks like creating domain specific languages. Like Haskell and Scala, Clojure supports the functional style of programming. By combining first-class functions, lexical closures, multimethods, and a full-fledged macro system, you get more than what typical OO languages can possibly offer. Moreover, you get ultra-clean code that reflects Lisp's famously-concise style. That means far fewer bugs when compared to stateful languages such as Java or C++.    Clojure in Action is a hands-on tutorial for the working programmer who has written code in a language like Java or Ruby, but has no prior experience with Lisp. It teaches Clojure from the basics to advanced topics using practical, real-world application examples. Blow through the theory and dive into practical matters like unit-testing, environment set up, all the way through building a scalable web-application using domain-specific languages, Hadoop, HBase, and RabbitMQ.    For readers coming from Java, you'll see how Clojure's use of the JVM makes it seamlessly interoperable with existing Java code. Learn how to access the thousands of existing libraries and frameworks. You'll also discover the concurrency semantics built into the language, which enable you to very easily write multi-threaded programs and take advantage of multiple cores in modern CPUs. With cloud-computing and multi-core becoming major trends, this is a huge advantage.    WHAT'S INSIDE        * A modern Lisp without all the baggage      * Functional programming that's also practical      * Unit-testing, embedding Clojure, distributed programming, and more      * State management and safe concurrency for multi-core CPUs      * Create domain specific languages (DSLs) with the macro system      * Write web-scale applications that scale transparently across multiple CPUs      * Seamless interoperability with thousands of Java libraries      * Get performance on level with raw Java",

      "longDescription": "Working With Objects is the authoritative account of the highly successful OOram method for software analysis, design, development, maintenance and reuse. OOram has been fine-tuned over a decade on hundreds of projects by Trygve Reenskaug and his collaborators. It is supported by available CASE tools, training, and consulting.    Working With Objects is the source on a method which takes an evolutionary step forward in object-oriented development practices. OOram adds the intuitively simple but powerful concept of a role to object-oriented models and methods. For example, imagine trying to describe a person as an object. The most effective way to do this would be to independently describe each of the roles that person adopts (parent, employee, and so on) and then define how the person supports them. These ideas form the heart of the OOram approach.    In a presentation rich with examples, Working With Objects is anything but the typical, dry methodology book. It tells real-life stories. It teaches how to apply role modeling and benefit from its inherent advantages, including:    Multiple views of the same model  Support for both data- and process-centered approaches  Large systems described through a number of distinct models  Derivation of composite models from simpler, base models  Decentralized management of very large systems  Programming language-independent design  Step-by-step transformation of models into implementations  Integration of powerful reuse techniques with work policies, processes and organization",

      "longDescription": "JavaScript developers commonly rely on collections of reusable JavaScript code--written by themselves or by someone else at their company. Alternatively, they rely on code from a third party. But in all these cases they need to know how to either construct a cross-browser library from scratch or be adept at using and maintaining their library of choice.    In Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja, JavaScript expert John Resig reveals the inside know-how of the elite JavaScript programmers. Written to be accessible to JavaScript developers with intermediate-level skills, this book will give you the knowledge you need to create a cross-browser JavaScript library from the ground up.    This book takes you on a journey towards mastering modern JavaScript development in three phases: design, construction, and maintenance. You first are given a base of strong, advanced JavaScript knowledge, enabling you to make decisions about the overall design of a library and how to tackle its eventual construction. The book then teaches you how to construct your library. It examines all the numerous tasks JavaScript libraries have to tackle and provides practical solutions and development strategies for their creation. It then guides you through the various maintenance techniques you will need to keep your code running well into the future.    With Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja you will have all the knowledge and skills available to build your own JavaScript library, or to understand how to use any modern JavaScript library available.",

While well-known among Java developers and other practitioners of object-oriented design, DI is only now gaining momentum in the .NET community. The Unity container released by Microsoft patterns & practices and the new Microsoft Extensibility Framework (MEF) make DI more relevant than ever for .NET developers.

In it, you will also learn to integrate DI together with such technologies as Windows Communication Foundation, ASP.NET MVC, Windows Presentation Foundation and other core .NET components.    Building on your existing knowledge of C# and the .NET platform, this book will be most beneficial for readers who have already built at least a few software solutions of intermediate complexity. Most examples are in plain C# without use of any particular DI framework. Later, the book introduces several well-known DI frameworks, such as StructureMap, Windsor and Spring.NET.

Millions of Internet users everyday exchange IM s and its use beyond messaging is just around the corner. For example, the new Microsoft .NET platform will be using instant messaging technology for data exchange.    This intermediate Java programming book provides Java programmers with the information and tools needed to create your own IM client and server software. You can use the software to create your own IM systems or integrate IM features into your existing software. Imagine allowing your customers to chat directly with technical support or other users from within your application!    This book focuses on the open source Jabber XML-based IM protocols (www.jabber.org) to create Java IM software. These open protocols allows your IM software to seamlessly communicate with the large number of other Jabber clients and servers available including commercial Jabber systems like the one that powers Disney's go.com IM.    Readers are assumed to know how to program in Java. No prior knowledge of Jabber or IM is needed.",

      "longDescription": "If you want to use Java to enhance your Web site, you have two choices: you can write the Java applet yourself or you can find an already written Java applet that meets your needs. If you prefer not to do the writing yourself, then Java Applets and Channels Without Programming is for you. It collects almost 100 applets on a CD with detailed instructions on how to use each applet. In addition, style issues are discussed in detail; not only will you learn how to use each applet, you will learn when and where it is appropriate to use each applet. The book also introduces the new concept of channels and shows how these can be used on your web site as well.    The CD-ROM also contains an exclusive applet configuration utility, a program that allows you to configure the Java applets on the CD-ROM in a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) environment. When using the utility to configure Java applets, you do not need to know any Java programming or even any HTML programming. All you do is change the value of a parameter and click on a button to see the resulting change to the applet. The applet configuration utility is written in Java and runs in your browser, so it runs on any computer platform for which there is a Java-enabled browser.    The CD-ROM also provides example web pages for more than 60 of the included applets, so you can learn how to use the applets in real-world situations.",

Its much-improved replacement, C++/CLI, now provides an effective bridge between the native and managed programming worlds. Using this technology, developers can combine existing C++ programs and .NET applications with little or no refactoring. Accessing .NET libraries like Windows Forms, WPF, and WCF from standard C++ is equally easy.    C++/CLI in Action is a practical guide that will help you breathe new life into your legacy C++ programs. The book begins with a concise C++/CLI tutorial. It then quickly moves to the key themes of native/managed code interop and mixed-mode programming. You   ll learn to take advantage of GUI frameworks like Windows Forms and WPF while keeping your native C++ business logic. The book also covers methods for accessing C# or VB.NET components and libraries. Written for readers with a working knowledge of C++.",

Eric Siber, Developpez.com",
      "longDescription": "Agile principles have been a breath of fresh air to many development teams stuck in the middle of a rigid, process-driven environment. Unfortunately, it's not so easy to bring Agile into an existing organization with established people and practices. Becoming Agile shows you practical techniques and strategies to move from your existing process to an Agile process without starting from scratch.    Many books discuss Agile from a theoretical or academic perspective. Becoming Agile takes a different approach and focuses on explaining Agile from a ground-level point-of-view. Author Greg Smith, a certified ScrumMaster with dozens of Agile projects under his belt, presents Agile principles in the context of a case study that flows throughout the book.    Becoming Agile focuses on the importance of adapting Agile principles to the realities of your environment. While Agile purists have often discouraged a    partial-Agile    approach, the reality is that in many shops a    purist    approach simply isn't a viable option. Over the last few years, Agile authorities have begun to discover that the best deployments of Agile are often customized to the specific situation of a given company.  As well, Becoming Agile addresses the cultural realities of deploying Agile and how to deal with the needs of executives, managers, and the development team during migration. The author discusses employee motivation and establishing incentives that reward support of Agile techniques.    Becoming Agile will show you how to create a custom Agile process that supports the realities of your environment. The process will minimize risk as you transition to Agile iteratively, allowing time for your culture and processes to acclimate to Agile principles.",

The book lays out the core of ActiveMQ in clear language, starting with the anatomy of a JMS message and moving quickly through connectors, message persistence, authentication and authorization. With the basics well in hand, you move into interesting examples of ActiveMQ at work, following a running Stock Portfolio application. You'll integrate ActiveMQ with containers like Geronimo and JBoss and learn to tie into popular Java-based technologies like Spring Framework.    Along the way, you'll pick up best practices forged out of the deep experience the authors bring to the book. You'll learn to integrate with non-Java technologies and explore advanced topics like broker topologies and configuration and performance tuning.    Additionally, the book will introduce readers to using Apache Camel with Apache ActiveMQ as a way to easily utilize the Enterprise Integration Patterns.",

Written for both new and experienced developers, this book explains the JMX specification and discusses its use through clean, well-discussed examples. It covers the JMX architecture and how to create all types of MBeans. It includes important advanced topics such as extending the JMX classes, combining with other Java technologies, the MBean relation service, dynamic MBean loading, and creating your own protocol adapters.",
